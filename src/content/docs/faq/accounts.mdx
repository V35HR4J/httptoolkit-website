    },
    {
      title: 'How do Pro accounts work?',
      text: "Pro accounts give you access to all paid product features, from import/export of intercepted traffic & rewriting rules to advanced configuration options.\n\nYour Pro account can be used on as many devices as you like, by logging into each device separately.\n\nThe account is permanently linked to a single individual - the primary user of the registered email address - and must not be shared or transferred. If it's clear that an account is being shared between multiple users then your account may be terminated (although we'll always get in touch with you about this first).",
    },
    {
      title: 'How do Team accounts work?',
      text: "Team accounts provide a group of people access to all paid features. They simplify group account management and billing, and allow transfer of licenses between individuals, as users leave and join the team.\n\nWith a Team subscription, rather than every team member signing up individually, managing their own Pro subscriptions and receiving their own invoices, one account owner can subscribe for many team members, and centrally pay and manage the team's account.\n\nEach Team subscription includes a total number of licenses for use by individual team members. The subscription is linked to the email addresses of each user who should be included as a team member. Each of those users gets access to all paid features in the HTTP Toolkit app.\n\nWhilst Pro accounts are permanently linked to an individual, Team licenses can be transferred between individuals, to add or remove members from the team. Each license can be transferred once every 48 hours.\n\nEach team member counts towards the total number of licenses available. The account owner by default does not, and cannot access paid features other than subscription management, but can be included in the list of team members too if you'd like.",
    },
    {
      title: 'How do I log into my account in the app?',
      text: `In the app, click "Get Pro", then "Log into existing account", and log in with your registered email address.`,
    },
    {
      title: "What's my account's password?",
      text: `HTTP Toolkit accounts are passwordless. Instead of setting a password, when you log in with your email address you'll be asked for a 6-digit code, which will be sent to your email.\n\nCodes are randomly generated, only the most recent code is valid, and codes expire after 15 minutes.\n\nThis avoids remembering & managing passwords, simplifies account setup, and remains just as secure as passwords, since anybody who can access your email could also use a "Forgot Password" link.`,
